              <h4>1) Help you know your income</h4>
              <p>The first thing you need to do is add up all of</br> your income. This can be easier said than done.
                Are your hours variable? Seasonal?</br> Do you work two (or three or even four) jobs?</br> Do you make any 
                side-income, such as scrapping, mowing lawns, or yard sale arbitrage?</p>
                <div class="text2">
                  <h4>2) What Are You Spending Now?</h4>
                  <p>Do you know how much you spend each month? If you are still </br>reading this, probably not. 
                    Or maybe you have tried to make a budget before but always seem to</br> have run out of money 
                    when you should have enough on paper.</p>
                </div>
            <div class="text3">
              <h4>3) Compare the Two</h4>
              <p>How does the first number compare to the second? Hopefully it is </br>larger. If not, then you are 
                piling on debt. Realizing this is probably what prompted you to try </br>to create a budget in the first place.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text4">
              <h4>4) Setting Goals</h4>
              <p>Once you aren’t going into debt to pay the bills or having to figure out which bill</br> isn’t getting paid this month,
                 it’s time to set some goals. Maybe you want to put some money aside to actually</br> retire before the age of 110. Or 
                 build an emergency fund to pay for any unexpected expenses like a car repair</br> or hospital bill.You could want to 
                 buy a new car without having to get a car loan. Or save up for a down payment on a house.</p>
